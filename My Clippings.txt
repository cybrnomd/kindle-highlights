Thought: 
writing is a way to communicate with the future. It is telepathy as Stephen King says. The author of this book is relatively obscure. But he wrote this book. He communicated what was important for him.
Then I had an epiphany about the ephemeral nature of life. I should write for the future. I should leave what i think as important for next humans. Every human being is unique and has something unique to contribute and should communicate that for future. Will I die with all thoughts buried in my breast?

But it is also true to say that God, in the traditional religious sense of the word, is not present in Sufism, or, rather, let us say that in Sufism God does not have a separate and distinct existence from the created universe as he does in orthodox religion, but is a part of it, a presence of unity and oneness. God in Sufism is not only the one but also the many. He is part of existence, the high point (as Breton calls it), the point at which what we call matter and what we call the spirit come together and all contradictions between the two are eliminated. He is not only the one who has brought the created universe into being, as an external being and without being joined to it, but he is also the created universe itself in its dynamism and infinity. He is not in the sky or on earth, but is the sky and earth together merged into one. Journeying to him does not demand that we leave existence and ourselves, but instead that we go further and further into existence and ourselves. The infinite (God) is not outside matter; it is in matter. The infinite is man and matter. He is somewhere or other but inside the place as well. He is another country, but it exists about us and in us.

The Sufi Ahmed bin Muhammad bin Ajiba al-Hassani, in contrast to Ibn Taymiyya, speaks about the origins of Sufism as follows: ‘Its subject is the divine essence of God, because the Sufi searches for him in order to know him, either through signs or witnessing him or seeing him with his own eyes. The first applies to those who are seeking [God/knowledge] (al-Talibuna) and the second to those who have attained it (al-Wasiluna). The founder of the science of Sufism is the Prophet himself (prayers and peace be upon him), who learnt it from God through revelation and inspiration. Gibril, may peace be upon him, first descended and brought the shari‘a (God’s law), and then, when it was established, he descended to the earth again with the truth, a chosen part of it, rather than its entirety. The first person to speak about Sufism and demonstrate it was Our Lord Ali (God’s grace be upon him)’ (al-Futuhat al-Ilahiya fi Sharh al-Mabahith al-Asliya, p. 5).

Ibn Ajiba sees man as ‘the divine model’. God has given him his spiritual attributes, so ‘man’s true nature and his secrets come from the secrets of God. When they are written about, they should not be referred to directly, but only mentioned indirectly and in code’ (ibid., pp. 41–43). The secret of ‘divinity, which God has placed in man, cannot be perfectly understood by anyone except God himself’ (ibid., pp. 46–47).

The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.

He says things like: You think you are quitting something, but you’re not quitting anything because cigarettes do nothing for you. You think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but it’s not. You can be social without smoking at all. You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not. Smoking does not relieve your nerves, it destroys them. Over and over, he repeats these phrases and others like them. “Get it clearly into your mind,” he says. “You are losing nothing and you are making marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money but also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in the length and quality of your future life.”

मानव-जीवन की सबसे महान घटना कितनी शांति के साथ घटित हो जाती है। वह विश्व का एक महान अंग, वह महत्तवाकांक्षाओं का प्रचंड सागर, वह उद्योग का अनंत भंडार, वह प्रेम और द्वेष, सुख और दुःख का लीला-क्षेत्र, वह बुद्धि और बल की रंगभूमि न जाने कब और कहां लीन हो जाती है, किसी को ख़बर नहीं होती। एक हिचकी भी नहीं, एक उच्छवास भी नहीं, एक आह भी नहीं निकलती! सागर की हिलोरों का कहां अंत होता है, कौन बता सकता है। ध्वनि कहां वायु-मग्न हो जाती है, कौन जानता है। मानवीय जीवन उस हिलोर के सिवा, उस ध्वनि के सिवा और क्या है! उसका अवसान भी उतना ही शांत, उतना ही अदृश्य हो तो क्या आश्चर्य है। भूतों के भक्त पूछते हैं, क्या वस्तु निकल गई?कोई विज्ञान का उपासक कहता है, एक क्षीण ज्योति निकल जाती है। कपोल-विज्ञान के पुजारी कहते हैं, आंखों से प्राण निकले, मुंह से निकले, ब्रह्मांड से निकले। कोई उनसे पूछे, हिलोर लय होते समय क्या चमक उठती है? ध्वनि लीन होते समय क्या मूर्तिमान हो जाती है? यह उस अनंत यात्रा का एक विश्राम मात्र है, जहां यात्रा का अंत नहीं, नया उत्थान होता है। कितना महान परिवर्तन! वह जो मच्छर के डंक को सहन न कर सकता था, अब उसे चाहे मिट्टी में दबा दो, चाहे अग्नि-चिता पर रख दो, उसके माथे पर बल तक न पड़ेगा।

The Way of the Sufi (Idries Shah)

Ibn el-Arabi of Spain instructed his followers in this most ancient dictum: There are three forms of knowledge. The first is intellectual knowledge, which is in fact only information and the collection of facts, and the use of these to arrive at further intellectual concepts. This is intellectualism. Second comes the knowledge of states, which includes both emotional feeling and strange states of being in which man thinks that he has perceived something supreme but cannot avail himself of it. This is emotionalism. Third comes real knowledge, which is called the Knowledge of Reality. In this form, man can perceive what is right, what is true, beyond the boundaries of thought and sense. Scholastics and scientists concentrate upon the first form of knowledge. Emotionalists and experientialists use the second form. Others use the two combined, or either one alternately. But the people who attain to truth are those who know how to connect themselves with the reality which lies beyond both these forms of knowledge. These are the real Sufis, the Dervishes who have Attained.

I prefer a different (and friendlier) definition: productivity means accomplishing what we intend to. If our plan today is to write three thousand words, rock a presentation with our leadership team, and catch up on our email, and we successfully accomplish all of those, we were perfectly productive. Likewise, if we intend to have a relaxing day and manage to do absolutely nothing, we’re again perfectly productive. Being busy doesn’t make us productive.

Packing party: pack everything like you are moving. Then take out items as you need them. After a week or two, the items not unpacked may be the ones you do not need but have kept, just in case.

Similarly, quit social media for thirty days, then evaluate. Do you realy need it? 

We think people value what we say by number of likes or comments. Point is it does not take much effort to do so on social media so it is not as important as unique visitors to a blog.

Arnold Bennet: 8 hrs work, it is not the day. You have 16 hrs remaining. Treat it like a day within a day. Read great literature, poetry. 

Plan how you will spend your leisure. Be deliberate about it. Read, exercise, connect with people. 

Don't be mindlessly scrolling through something. 

Mind does not tire, it needs change.
